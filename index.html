		<h1>Mumps cases in central Ohio</h1>
		<div id="dygraph"></div>
		<div id="dygraph-labels"></div>
		<p>The first case of mumps detected in Franklin County was January 7, with the first case at OSU detected February 10.<sup><a href="">1</a></sup></p>
		<p>At Ohio State University, the virus has affected 115 students, 18 staff members, two family members, and 25 with strong ties to the university community, with most affected OSU-affiliated persons living in Columbus. 97 females and 63 males are affected at OSU, from three to 58 years of age. The university-linked cases include residents in Columbus and Athens, Belmont, Clark, Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Hamilton, Licking, and Pickaway counties.<sup><a href="http://columbus.gov/Templates/Detail.aspx?id=69188">2</a></sup></p>
		<p>Three to four cases have been reported at Columbus State Community College.<sup><a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/story/25300367/mumps-outbreak-grows-to-253-cases">3</a></sup></p>
		<p>Two cases have been reported in Olentangy Local Schools, leading school officials to tell students without the vaccine and with compromised immune systems to stay home. <sup><a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/18/olentangy-students-without-mumps-vaccine-must-stay-home-for-25-days.html">4</a></sup></p>

		<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		
		<h2 id="q-sick">Am I sick?</h2>
		<p>Symptoms of the mumps are similar to the flu and include a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, swollen glands under the ears or jaw, and a loss of appetite. Symptoms may last seven to 10 days.</p>
		<p>If you suspect that you are sick, visit a doctor. They will provide you with better information than random pages on the Internet.</p>
		<p>The mumps virus spreads through saliva and through aerosols produced by sneezing or coughing. Sneeze only into your shoulder or elbow - <i>not</i> your hands. Wash your hands. The virus takes 22 days to incubate and infect your body.<p>
		
		<h2 id="q-vaccinated">Should I get vaccinated?</h2>
		<p>If you have not already received both doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. If you have received only one dose, you should receive your booster dose as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>The MMR vaccine can be obtained at your family doctor, pharmacy clinics, university student health services (<a href="https://www.osu.edu/mumpsinfo">OSU</a>), and Columbus Public Health walk-in clinics. The CPH walk-in clinic is held at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/240+Parsons+Ave+Columbus+OH+43215">240 Parsons Avenue, Columbus, Ohio</a> at the following times:
			<ul>
				<li>Mondays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Tuesdays 10 a.m. - 7 p.m.</li>
				<li>Wednesdays 8 a.m. - noon</li>
				<li>Thursdays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Fridays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 id="q-harmful">Are vaccines harmful?</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/10-vaccine-myths---busted">No</a>. </p>
		<p>Mumps can lead to deafness and infertility. Vaccination protects you and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/21zc6n/i_would_rage_if_this_was_handed_to_me/cgicl4u">your children</a> against that risk. Unvaccinated people can transmit mumps. After both doses, the MMR vaccine is only 85%-95% effective, meaning that people who have been vaccinated are still susceptible. If you fail to get the MMR vaccine, you are endangering not only yourself but everyone you may come in contact with.</p> 
		<p>If your objections to vaccination are based on the idea that vaccines may cause harm, rest assured that the thiomersal mercury preservative was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4767530/vaccine-deniers-inside-the-dumb-dangerous-new-fad">removed from vaccines in 2001</a>. On top of that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield's research</a> alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism was <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmj.c5347">unethical, fraudulent, irresponsible, falsified and abusive</a>. He planned to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c5258">exploit the vaccine panic for profit</a>. If you follow Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine advice, your child is more at risk of a debilitating illness than of acquiring autism.</p>
		<p>Quoting from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/21zc6n/i_would_rage_if_this_was_handed_to_me/cgicl4u">a discussion thread</a> linked earlier:</p>
		<blockquote><p>... vaccinating a child is like playing Russian roulette with a gun that has hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of chambers and only 1 bullet.</p>
		<p>However, choosing not to vaccinate swaps that gun out with another, with stupendously fewer chambers and also more bullets.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Vaccines save lives.</p>
