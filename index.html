		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>Am I sick?</h2>
		<p>Symptoms of the mumps are similar to the flu and include a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, swollen glands under the ears or jaw, and a loss of appetite. Symptoms may last seven to 10 days.</p>
		<p>If you suspect that you are sick, visit a doctor. They will provide you with better information than random pages on the Internet.</p>
		<p>The mumps virus spreads through saliva and through aerosols produced by sneezing or coughing. Wash your hands, and sneeze into your shoulder or elbow - <i>not</i> your hands. The virus takes 22 days to incubate and infect your body.<p>
		<h2>Should I get vaccinated?</h2>
		<p>If you have not already received both doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. If you have received only one dose, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>The MMR vaccine can be obtained at your family doctor, pharmacy clinics, university student health services (<a href="https://www.osu.edu/mumpsinfo">OSU</a>), and Columbus Public Health walk-in clinics. The CPH walk-in clinic is held at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/240+Parsons+Ave+Columbus+OH+43215">240 Parsons Avenue, Columbus, Ohio</a> at the following times:
			<ul>
				<li>Mondays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Tuesdays 10 a.m. - 7 p.m.</li>
				<li>Wednesdays 8 a.m. - noon</li>
				<li>Thursdays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Fridays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Are vaccines harmful?</h2>
		<p>No. Just -- <a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/10-vaccine-myths---busted">no</a>. </p>
		<p>Unvaccinated people transmit dangerous diseases. Mumps can lead to deafness and infertility. Vaccination protects you and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/21zc6n/i_would_rage_if_this_was_handed_to_me/cgicl4u">your children</a> against that risk. The thiomersal mercury preservative was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4767530/vaccine-deniers-inside-the-dumb-dangerous-new-fad">removed from vaccines in 2001</a>. Andrew Wakefield's research and paper alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">unethical, fraudulent, irresponsible, falsified and abusive</a>.</p>
		<p>Vaccines save lives.</p>
