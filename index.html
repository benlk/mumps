		<p>The first case of mumps detected in Franklin County was January 7, with the first case at OSU detected February 10.</p>
		<p>At Ohio State University, the virus has affected 128 students, 24 staff members, three family members, and 33 with strong ties to the university community, with 86.4 percent of affected OSU-affiliated persons living in Columbus. Patients include 110 females and 73 males in the OSU community, from three to 58 years of age. The university-linked cases include residents in Columbus and Athens, Belmont, Cincinnati, Clark, Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Hamilton, Licking, Madison, Pickaway and Ross counties.<sup><a href="http://columbus.gov/Templates/Detail.aspx?id=69188">1</a></sup> Cases unrelated to Ohio State have been found in Ashland, Butler, Coshocton, Delaware, Lucas, Medina, Pickaway, Pike and Richland counties.<sup><a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/story/25322507/mumps-outbreak-grows-to-269-cases">2</a></sup></p>

		<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		
		<h2 id="q-sick">Am I sick?</h2>
		<p>Symptoms of the mumps are similar to the flu and include a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, swollen glands under the ears or jaw, and a loss of appetite. Symptoms may last seven to 10 days.</p>
		<p>If you suspect that you are sick, visit a doctor. They will provide you with better information than random pages on the Internet.</p>
		<p>The mumps virus spreads through saliva and through aerosols produced by sneezing or coughing. Sneeze only into your shoulder or elbow - <i>not</i> your hands. Wash your hands. The virus takes 22 days to incubate and infect your body.<p>
		
		<h2 id="q-vaccinated">Should I get vaccinated?</h2>
		<p>If you have not already received both doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. If you have received only one dose, you should receive your booster dose as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>The MMR vaccine can be obtained at your family doctor, pharmacy clinics, university student health services (<a href="https://www.osu.edu/mumpsinfo">OSU</a>), and Columbus Public Health walk-in clinics. The CPH walk-in clinic is held at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/240+Parsons+Ave+Columbus+OH+43215">240 Parsons Avenue, Columbus, Ohio</a> at the following times:
			<ul>
				<li>Mondays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Tuesdays 10 a.m. - 7 p.m.</li>
				<li>Wednesdays 8 a.m. - noon</li>
				<li>Thursdays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
				<li>Fridays 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="q-harmful">Are vaccines harmful?</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/10-vaccine-myths---busted">No</a>. </p>
		<p>Mumps can lead to deafness and infertility. Vaccination protects you and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/21zc6n/i_would_rage_if_this_was_handed_to_me/cgicl4u">your children</a> against that risk. Unvaccinated people can transmit mumps. After both doses, the MMR vaccine is only 85%-95% effective, meaning that people who have been vaccinated are still susceptible. If you fail to get the MMR vaccine, you are endangering not only yourself but everyone you may come in contact with.</p> 
		<p>If your objections to vaccination are based on the idea that vaccines may cause harm, rest assured that the thiomersal mercury preservative was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4767530/vaccine-deniers-inside-the-dumb-dangerous-new-fad">removed from vaccines in 2001</a>. On top of that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield's research</a> alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism was <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmj.c5347">unethical, fraudulent, irresponsible, falsified and abusive</a>. He planned to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c5258">exploit the vaccine panic for profit</a>. If you follow Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine advice, your child is more at risk of a debilitating illness than of acquiring autism.</p>
		<p>Quoting from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/21zc6n/i_would_rage_if_this_was_handed_to_me/cgicl4u">a discussion thread</a> linked earlier:</p>
		<blockquote><p>... vaccinating a child is like playing Russian roulette with a gun that has hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of chambers and only 1 bullet.</p>
		<p>However, choosing not to vaccinate swaps that gun out with another, with stupendously fewer chambers and also more bullets.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Vaccines save lives.</p>
		
		<h2 id="q-official">Is this an official page?</h2>
		<p>Nope! This is intended as a public service.</p> 
		<p>It's a side project by <a href="http://benlk.com">Ben Keith</a>, a graduating senior at The Ohio State University. He will shortly hold a B.S. in Agricultural Communication with a minor in plant pathology. He does web design and journalism. </p>
		
		<h2 id="q-embed">Can I use your chart on my site?</h2>
		<p>Sure! Here's the embed code:</p>
		<code><pre>
&lt;iframe width="100%" height="400px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"
src="http://benlk.github.io/mumps/embed.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
		</pre></code>
		<p>There's no tracking code on it now, but I will probably add one in the future.</p>
